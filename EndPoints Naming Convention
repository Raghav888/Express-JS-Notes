1. Endpoint name should be Noun, Plural, Predictable and consistent
2. Avoid Techincal names in endpoints name
3. Follow Hiearchical naming convention
    customers/id
    customers/id/address
4. If endpoints in sentences sounds good, that means our API design is good
ex: customers/id -> Get all customers ids
