semver- Semnatic versioning
Its universla agreement that all software will follow semver.
Ex: 5.2.18
In above example, 5 is major version, 2 is minor version, 18 is patch.
Patch version is changed, when bugs are fixed
Minor version is changed when new feature is added but it is compatiable with previous vrsion
Major Version is changed when new features is added and its compatiability also changes. In it we dont gurantee that the new version will work as same.


Now if your package depends on external package then we need to specify which package we need.

Greater than : >5.12.1
Compatible changes: ^5.12.1 here minor and patch version will changed as per compatability
